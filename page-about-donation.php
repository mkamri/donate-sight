According to the EBAA there were more than 85,000 transplants worldwide performed in 2019. <strong>The need for corneal tissue is never satisfied.</strong> In cornea transplantation, the damaged cornea is replaced with a healthy, donated tissue.</p>

            <h3 class="blue mb-3">What does an Eye Bank do?</h3>
            <p>An eye bank is a medical facility where technicians surgically recover deceased ocular tissue from consented donors and then evaluate it with technology specific to ophthalmology. Donor suitability is then determined based on medical/social history, serological/other laboratory testing, and final tissue suitability. Finally, the cornea is processed to surgeon specifications, and then distributed for transplant locally, nationally, and internationally.</p>
